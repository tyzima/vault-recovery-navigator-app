## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend Components

1. **WebSocket Server** (`server/index.js`)
   - Real-time message broadcasting
   - User authentication and channel management
   - Connection state management

2. **REST API Endpoints**
   - `GET /api/chat/channels` - List user channels
   - `POST /api/chat/channels` - Create new channel
   - `GET /api/chat/channels/:id/messages` - Load messages
   - `POST /api/chat/channels/:id/messages` - Send message (fallback)
   - `POST /api/chat/channels/:id/join` - Join private channel
   - `POST /api/chat/channels/:id/read` - Mark as read

3. **Database Tables**
   - `chat_channels` - Channel information
   - `channel_memberships` - User channel memberships
   - `chat_messages` - All messages
   - `message_attachments` - File attachments (ready for future)

### Frontend Components

1. **FloatingChat** (`src/components/chat/FloatingChat.tsx`)
   - Main floating chat window
   - State management for open/closed/minimized
   - Channel navigation

2. **ChatWindow** (`src/components/chat/ChatWindow.tsx`)
   - Message display with grouping
   - Message input with typing indicators
   - Real-time message updates

3. **ChatChannelList** (`src/components/chat/ChatChannelList.tsx`)
   - Channel list with unread counts
   - Channel type indicators
   - Last message timestamps

4. **CreateChannelDialog** (`src/components/chat/CreateChannelDialog.tsx`)
   - Channel creation form
   - Validation and error handling

5. **useChat Hook** (`src/hooks/useChat.tsx`)
   - WebSocket connection management
   - Message and channel state
   - Real-time event handling

6. **ChatClient** (`src/lib/chatClient.ts`)
   - WebSocket communication layer
   - HTTP API fallbacks
   - Event system for real-time updates

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Start the Application

```bash
# The chat system is already integrated!
npm run start:local
```

### 2. Login and Test

1. Go to `https://runbooks.local`
2. Login with `admin@vault.local` / `admin123`
3. Look for the blue "Chat" button in the bottom-right corner
4. Click to open the chat system

### 3. Default Channels

The system automatically creates these default channels:
- **#general** - General team discussion
- **#incident-response** - Emergency incident coordination  
- **#runbook-updates** - Notifications about runbook changes

## 💡 Usage Guide

### Opening Chat
- Click the floating blue "Chat" button in the bottom-right corner
- Chat auto-opens when you receive messages
- Badge shows total unread message count

### Navigation
- **Channel List View**: See all available channels with unread counts
- **Chat View**: Active conversation with message history
- **Quick Channel Switch**: Use the sidebar when in chat view

### Sending Messages

- Shows typing indicators to other users
- Messages are grouped by user and time proximity

### Creating Channels
1. Click the "+ New" button in the channel list
2. Enter channel name, description (optional), and type
3. Choose between Public (anyone can join) or Private (invite only)

### Channel Types
- **Public** 🔓: All organization members can see and join
- **Private** 🔒: Only invited members can access
- **Direct** 👥: One-on-one conversations (ready for future)

## 🔧 Technical Details

- Verify server is running on port 3001

### Messages Not Sending
- Check WebSocket connection status (indicator in chat header)
- Verify network connectivity
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors

### Can't See Channels
- Verify user role and permissions
- Check if channels exist in database
- Ensure client_id matches for organization channels
